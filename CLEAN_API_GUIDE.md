  gameCode: '1234',
  playerId: 'player_id', 
  playerName: 'Player Name'
});
```

### Key Events to Listen For
```javascript
// Players joining/leaving
socket.on('player-joined', (data) => {
  console.log('New player:', data.player);
  // Update UI with new player list
});

// Game automatically starts when 4 players join
socket.on('game-auto-started', (data) => {
  console.log('Game starting!');
  // Switch to game screen
});

// New round begins
socket.on('new-round', (data) => {
  console.log('Round', data.roundNumber, 'of 12');
  console.log('Current player:', data.currentPlayer);
  console.log('Question:', data.question);
  // Show question and prediction interface for other 3 players
});

// Round completed - see who predicted correctly
socket.on('round-completed', (data) => {

  console.log('Correct predictions:', data.predictions.filter(p => p.isCorrect));
  console.log('Updated leaderboard:', data.leaderboard);
  // Show results and updated scores
});

// Game finished after 3 full cycles
